## Notes for Mozilla 5 min. call on Reproducibility

### Creating the Guide

- [RopenSci](https://ropensci.org/).
- My [blog post](http://cierareports.org/blog/2014/05/14/OpenSci/index.html) on my experience at the Unconference. It was (is) awesome!

I suggested a project to create a Guide to Reproducibility because:
-  I didn't know how to make an R package!
-  I found it difficult to find information on the "correct" way to work reproducibly
-  My ulterior motive: learn from the people in the room

I worked with three remote individuals to build the site: Jeff Hollister, Ben Marwick, and Eduard Sz√∂cs. 

We knew we wanted to guide to be 

-  introductory level and approachable
-  not too much information 
-  allow anyone to contribute 
-  be a Github project that even beginner Git users to feel they could contribute to.

### Lessons Learned since creating the project:

-  I love Github. 
-  Using Git and Jekyll are huge learning curves to tackle and barrier for people contributing. 
-  Most importantly there is no "right" way to work reproducibly, Reproducibility is a state of mind. There is only better ways to be reproducible. 

### Why Reproducibility is tough 

Data Carpentry two day bootcamp: [http://www.datacarpentry.org//rr-workshop/](http://www.datacarpentry.org//rr-workshop/)

 -  Every persons workflow is different
 -  Many tools that require effort to learn
 -  Reproducible tool landscape is constantly changing. 
 -  Reproducibility in the end is really just organization and everyone has a different way they like to be organized

### Tips for working more reproducible

- Open a no judgement dialog with people you work with. I believe the best way to work and learn reproducibility is with your team you work with. 
-  The main motivation should be making your life/work easier.
-  Reproduciblity is a state of mind and you can always do better
